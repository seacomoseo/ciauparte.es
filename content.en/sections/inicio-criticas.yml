      From the circus point of view,
      we are in front of an acrobatic troupe without equal in the Spanish contemporary circus,
      that has been incorporating more and more tricks and rescuing circus techniques of enormous risk and spectacularity,
      such as the Russian bar.

      It is clear that for UpArte there are no limits.

      The circus technique is impeccable.

      Through a perfectly choreographed development,
      the show plunges us into a crescendo of emotions.

      One of those shows difficult to describe.
      That leaves you with the ay in your mouth.
      That surprises.
      The **concentration, effort and dedication** of the UpArte members was matched by an audience that did not fail to applaud a single one of the acrobatics, the somersaults, the somersaults several meters high or the human towers.
      Without exaggeration.
      The plasticity of the exercise impressed.
