    description: |
      We are a contemporary circus company specializing in acrobatic tricks, banquets, towers, jumps into the void (both physical and metaphorical) and above all, we specialize in playing and enjoying what we do.

      We offer shows in theatrical and street format for all audiences, in which, little by little, we have acquired a personal style characterized by: a high technical level, a constant search for balance between risk, aesthetics and humor, and artists without characters, but with a lot to offer. Works that will hardly leave the public indifferent.
