      Inspired by the divine proportion and the number Phi, Áureo aims to immerse the viewer in an atmosphere governed by harmony and balance. Acrobatics of a high technical level are executed in a space in which the relationships between objects and people were calculated with precision and argument. Nothing is arbitrary. The aim of **Áureo** is to create in the spectator an attraction towards the visual, a contrast between the coziness and the uncertainty of each acrobatics, each jump, each fall.

      Despite not having any storyline, the play invites us to travel a path of transformation, where the scenery will be developed throughout the show. The performers, plain and natural, will take us by the hand through this path of images, acrobatics, music and emotions. Within this aesthetic and orderly environment, humor interrupts without being avoided. Situations that are resolved in the most human way bring to light the absurdity of normality. Áureo is a dynamic and entertaining circus show that combines different circus disciplines, acrobatics, acrobatics, banquette, Russian bar, juggling and the manipulation of the objects that make up the scenography.

      In addition to attracting with the aesthetics of the space, great technical level and a spontaneous atmosphere, Áureo seeks to arouse in the audience the feeling that there is something else behind all that movement of bodies and bars: something that makes them smile.
