      Six bodies on stage go up, down, dance, but above all, they jump! UpArte presents a lively show that maintains the high level acrobatic technique, but this time the artists show their more human side with small touches of humor. A few boxes and a lot of fun.

      **Everything fits** is a fresh, visual work, where its six components will infect the spectator with the joy of their music and more intense emotions by means of jumps, flights and human towers, showing the most personal and funniest side of acrobatics. A show of self-improvement and confidence, full of enthusiasm and with great capacity to spread it. The whole show has a frenetic rhythm, fresh and complicit, within a simple space that will make the audience enjoy the show.

      > The jury also valued the dedication and enthusiasm in the work and its connection with the roots of the most technical circus ... a work full of acrobatics at a pace that takes the viewer from beginning to end without barely noticing and without closing the mouth of the surprises.
